# Who am I?
I'm a software engineering professional with a decade of hands-on experience creating software and managing engineering teams. I graduated from the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca) in Honours Computer Engineering in 2012.

I started blogging at [https://www.devleader.ca](https://www.devleader.ca) in order to share my experiences about leadership (especially in a startup environment) and development experience. Since then, I have been trying to create content on various platforms to be able to share information about programming and engineering leadership.

At the time of writing, I am a principal software engineering manager at Microsoft. My day-to-day work requires a lot less hands-on coding, but I still actively program in my spare time. Consider [subscribing to my free software engineering and dotnet-focused newsletter](https://subscribe.devleader.ca) that I publish weekly:
