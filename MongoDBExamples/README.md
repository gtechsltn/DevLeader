# What's In This Solution?

This solution contains projects focusing on working with MongoDB from C#. There's a strong focus on using the MongoDB.Driver NuGet package which will allow you to easily interact with a MongoDB instance.

Each one of these projects will have articles and/or videos associated with them [on my website](https://www.devleader.ca/?s=mongodb) and [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DevLeader/search?query=mongodb).
